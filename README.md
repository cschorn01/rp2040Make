## ![Description](https://img.shields.io/badge/Description-FFFFFF?style=for-the-badge)
Run `./rp2040Make.sh`, or `./a.out`, to perform the Raspberry Pi Pico build command sequence.There is also a version that works with FreeRTOS in [raspberry_pi_pico_lora_template](https://github.com/cschorn01/raspberry_pi_pico_lora_template/blob/main/README.md).


## ![Functionality](https://img.shields.io/badge/Functionality-FFFFFF?style=for-the-badge)

Instead of running the five commands used for building a Raspberry Pi Pico project:
```bash
rm -r build
mkdir build
cmake -D PICO_SDK_PATH=/Absolute/Path/To/pico-sdk -B ./build  #cmake from project folder into build folder
make -C build  # -C changes folder to build before running make
```
Replace that with shell script, or C code running shell commands, including `export PICO_SDK_PATH=/Path/To/pico-sdk`.

## ![File Structure](https://img.shields.io/badge/file_structure-FFFFFF?style=for-the-badge)

The file structure shown here is the layout for the [Raspberry Pi Github Examples](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master) with this file included.

- pico_projects
    - [rp2040Make.c](https://github.com/cschorn01/rp2040Make/blob/main/rp2040Make.c)
    - [rp2040Make.sh](https://github.com/cschorn01/rp2040Make/blob/main/rp2040Make.sh)
    - CMakeLists.txt
    - main.c

## ![How to Use](https://img.shields.io/badge/how_to_use-FFFFFF?style=for-the-badge)

For this to work on your machine, add the path to your *pico_sdk* folder in the `cmake` command.

```bash
cmake -D PICO_SDK_PATH=/Absolute-Path-To/pico-sdk -B ./build
```

Then the `rp2040Make.sh` file will need its execute permissions changes. For this run:

```bash
chmod +x rp2040Make.sh
```
Now this file can be run using `./rp2040Make.sh`.

For the C code, after you add your path, just compile the code and run the output.

```bash
gcc rp2040Make.c
./a.out
```

After running these command line prompts you should see a build folder appear, the output from CMake, and the build folder become populated.
